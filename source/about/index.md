My name is *Berkay Eren Konuk*, but I usually go by the names **Berikai** or **Verdant** online.

I'm a big fan of open source and I love learning new things about software technologies. I'm usually interested in server-side Javascript technologies and Java bytecode manipulation. I love analyzing software systems and finding ways to integrate my own solutions. ...and "I use Arch, btw." ðŸ˜„

I create dubstep and drum and bass oriented experimental music. You can check out my music on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/verdantbass). I love the piano and composing melodies with it, play it to ease my soul, and include it in the outro of my tracks to give them a breath of fresh air. Although I have EDM in my blood, I have a diverse taste in music of genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Shoegaze, Post-rock...

I'm currently studying mechatronics engineering (sophomore) in Izmir University of Economics.
