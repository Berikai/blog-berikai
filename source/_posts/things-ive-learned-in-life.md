- Most people are actually **good** _(usually with respect to their self-centric morals)_, yet **stupid**.
  
  - **Evil** in the world comes from the **stupidity of society** manipulated by wealthy people's interests.

- Every act that mislead one from one's goals are **addictions**, thus weakness.
  
  - Religion, masturbation, social media; all of them are **addictions**, and should be avoided at all cost.
  
- The best way to be psychologically stable: **WORK OUT EVERY DAY!**
  
  - Happiness is **the rate of change** of the function of one's **life's ups and downs**.
    
  - Constantly just being happy is impossible, but the real deal is having a **healthy brain chemistry**.

  - Healthy body -> healthy brain -> healthy mentality => **healthy (+freedom of) thinking**.

### What does **"people are stupid"** mean?

- A vector of stupidity is the **vulnerability of tending to consume easy dopamine**; wasting their energy of thinking into artificially crafted niches like _politics, sports, trends, events, news_.
  
- Another vector of stupidity is **being vulnerable to emotional (or actually any kind of) manipulation**. Masses are manipulated by the ones who crack the code of the way human brain works. People are stupid because they don't educate themselves even though they are somewhat aware of the things going on. They are okay with it because, **again, they addict to the easy dopamin the system rewards themselves**.
  
- Yet another vector of stupidity is **people aren't honest themselves**. Most **people don't want to solve problems the world has, they actually just like complaining about it**. If there were no problems, people would create another problem to complain with.
  
- Although there are many, I'll give one last vector of stupidity. People can't stand the feeling of loneliness. They always label them to one of the groups. This may be religion, a football team, or even something in between in a larger friend group. They **lack self-confidence to be able to stand by themselves**, as who they are. At the end, the **society becomes poor in terms of individual variety**.
  

You see, most **people don't think consistently**. They aren't logical. 

People smoke cigarettes, pay people to educate themselves because they like being herded sheeps, addicted to artifical emotions, work full-time and complain although they can solve problems they just make themselves believe they are not; they become what they think about of themselves, and **they fool themselves**.

### Motto

Be disciplined, **build your ego**!

**Believe** in yourself, **believe** in what you are able to achieve!

Don't let your brain hypnotised by the every attention killing traps of this century, to **make you a slave**.

They are in our brains as if "1984" has become real.

**Realize!**

**Save** your brain, **protect** your **freedom**.
